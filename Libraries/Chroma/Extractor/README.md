# FurniExtractor
Simple SWF to PNG/JSON extractor for Habbo Hotel furniture asset files

This tool by default will read *.swf files from Z:\furni with no recursion.
Output files will be stored as folders with their respective sprite name in this directory.

It is strongly recommended to use a RAMDisk as Z:\, this operation is very IO-heavy.
